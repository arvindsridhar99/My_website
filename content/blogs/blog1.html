<p>Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We
can get the latest data by running the following</p>

<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and
year since 2015</p>
<p>However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the
following two graphs.</p>
<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of
weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks
14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).</p>
<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of
rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each
week/month of 2020-2022 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the
calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
<p>Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected
rentals? Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should use the mean to calculate the expected rentals.
From the distribution of rentals in past eight years, we could tell that the
distributions are closed. The distributions are closed to normal distribution
and the mean works perfectly well for a normal distribution. Furthermore, not
many outliers exists and the amount of data we use is huge and it can reduce
the effect of outliers. Some outliers are caused by events that could happen
again in the future.</p>
